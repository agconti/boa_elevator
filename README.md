============

My solution to reverse engineering an optimized and non optimized elevator algorithm for BOA.

Check out the soultion in [boa_elevator.py](https://github.com/agconti/boa_elevator/blob/master/boa_elevator.py).

The elevator runs in two modes:

*  A is an in efficent mode that can only process requests seqentially.
*  B is a more efficent mode that can handle multiple concurent requests and process them efficently. 

Heres a look at running it:
